# Facial-Expression-Recognition-on-Aff2-Wild-Dataset-using-PyTorch
In this project we explore, clean and utilise Aff-2 Wild Dataset to perform Facial Expression Recognition.

The projects consists of two assignements respectively, Assignment 1 and Assigment 2.

Assignment 1 deals with an in-depth comparison of already existing FER research and discusses conclusion.
Assignment 2 deals with deployment of different ML models on Aff2-Wild Dataset and draws comparison including advantages and drawbacks of different approaches.
